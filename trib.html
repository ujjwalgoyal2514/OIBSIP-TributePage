            </div>
            <div class="block2">On March 14, Hermann Einstein, an engineer and salesman, and Pauline Einstein had their first child in Ulm, German Empire. And they called him
               Albert Einstein.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="history">
            <div class="block2"> At the age of 16,  he took the entrance exams for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School, even though he did not reach the required standard in some subjects, he obtained exceptional marks in physics and mathematics. Following the advice of the director of the Polytechnic, he attended a Swiss school to complete high school, and the following year he began his studies at college.

               <img src="hat.jpg" style="background-blend-mode:hard-light;" alt="" width="150px;height:150px">
            </div>
            <div class="block2">Einstein got his bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. But during his graduation, he missed his classes to stay in the labs, and he never paid much attention to his professors. And so, he was even turned down for a job as a lab assistant. He ended up getting a job at the Swiss Patent Office.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="history">
            <div class="block2"> Many disbelieved that a public servant could do science. But this was Einstein's miraculous year, where he published not just one, but four works that would change human history.
            </div>
            <div class="block1"><p>1905</p></div>

         <div class="history2">
            <div class="block1"> <p></p>
            </div>
            <div class="block2">The first work was released in March, and in it there was a shocking hypothesis, despite decades of evidence that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it was actually a particle.
               Showing how mysterious phenomena such as the photoelectric effect could be explained by this hypothesis.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="history2">
            <div class="block2"> This ided was ridiculed for a long time, but after 20 years, the wave-particle duality would become the basis for the quantum revolution.

            <div class="block1"> <p></p>
            </div>
            <div class="block2">Two months later, in May, he did a study on the existence of atoms, although some theories were based on the idea of invisible atoms, many scientists still believed it was fiction. But Eisstein used a clever argument to convince them: he showed that the behavior of small particles moving randomly in a liquid medium, known as Brownian motion, could be predicted by the collision of millions of invisible atoms.</div>

         <div class="history2">
            <!-- <div class="block1"> <p></p>
            </div> -->
            <div class="block3">The third work was published in June, and it came about due to a problem Einstein had with the inconsistency between two fundamental principles of physics: the principle of relativity, said that absolute motion could not be defined, but in electromagnetic theory, it stated that he existed. The discrepancy between these questions brought Einstein into what he called psychic tension. After much debate on the subject, Einstein realized that this contradiction could be resolved if the speed of light remained constant, regardless of the frame of reference adopted. And he
               formulated what became known as special relativity.</div>
         </div>
         <div class="history2">
            <!-- <div class="block1"> <p></p>
            </div> -->
            <div class="block3">In September he published his fourth work, which was a kind of complement to the work of relativity. Taking a closer look at his earlier work, Albert realized that it also meant that mass and energy were equivalent.
               And his relationship could be represented by the equation that marked his life and history:</div>
